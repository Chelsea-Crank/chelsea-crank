                <h3>Get Set Learn Website</h3>
                <p>This was such a fun website to work on. I was able to give some of the graphics and elements subtle transitions, play with colour, and build a way to navigate through a lot of information and resources.</p>

                <h3>Miss Robin Website</h3>
                <p>Bringing the work of a fine artist to interwebs was a challenge that I eagerly embraced. The artist was thrilled with the simple layouts that allow the viewer to embrace the artwork.</p>

                <h3>Rogue Pickings Website</h3>
                <p>I coded this home page for client who wanted to freshen up the look of their existing page. As well as a fresh design, they wanted a clean and simple, easy to navigate page. </p>
